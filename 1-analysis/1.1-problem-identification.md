# 1.1 Problem Identification

### Why do people play video games?

Motivation to play video games comes from a persons self-efficacy(their own confidence in their ability to complete a task necessary for specific performance attainments) to complete a task leading to satisfaction when the task is complete, this then means that the player has motivation to keep interacting with the virtual environment around them and gain new competencies as they progress.  People feel this sense of satisfaction because it is inherently satisfactory to bring about a change to the environment, like repeatedly turning on and off a light switch.  This cycle of motivation is called effectance motivation.  This process is also influenced by failures and challenge alongside success([Klimmt and Hartmann, 2006, pp.138–139](../reference-list.md)).



### The Gaming Industry in the COVID-19 pandemic

Another reason why people are starting to play video games is because over the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, due to the inability of the public to participate in activities outside of their household, leading to video games sales approached $1.6 billion which is a 35% year over year increase([Smith, 2020](../reference-list.md)).  Games are a way to escape reality so when we were locked down video games gave people a way to effect a virtual environment as being at home meant that many had little control outside of their house.



### The Benefits of Video Games

Games also promote cognitive benefits.  This links to effectence motivation cycle as when the player interacts with the games environment in the they develop more competencies([Klimmt and Hartmann, 2006, pp.138–139](../reference-list.md)).  For example, in shooter games players have shown faster and more accurate attention allocation, higher spatial resolution, and enhanced mental rotation abilities([Green and Bavelier, 2012](../reference-list.md)).  The spatial skill benefits of playing video games are comparable to a year long university level course([Uttal et al., 2013](../reference-list.md)).  Furthermore, video games promote greater creativity which is not shown from uses of other pieces of technology([Granic, Lobel and Rutger C. M. E. Engels, 2014](../reference-list.md)).
