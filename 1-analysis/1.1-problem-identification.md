# 1.1 Problem Identification

## Why do people play video games?

Motivation to play video games comes from a persons self-efficacy(their own confidence in their ability to complete a task necessary for specific performance attainments) which leads to satisfaction when the task is complete, this then means that the player has motivation to keep interacting with the environment around them and gain new competencies as they progress.  People feel this sense of satisfaction because they have imposed a change on the environment the same as the satisfaction gained from turning on a light switch, this cycle of motivation is called effectance motivation.  This process is also influenced by failures and challenge alongside success(Klimmt and Hartmann, 2006, pp.138â€“139).



Over the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, due to the inability of the public to participate in activities outside of their household, video games sales approached $1.6 billion which is a 35% year over year increase(Smith, 2020).
