# 1.1 Problem Identification

## Why do people play video games?

Motivation to play video games comes from a persons self-efficacy(their own confidence in their ability to complete a task)(Klimmt and Hartmann, 2006, pp.138â€“139).  Over the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, due to the inability of the public to participate in activities outside of their household, video games sales approached $1.6 billion which is a 35% year over year increase(Smith, 2020).
