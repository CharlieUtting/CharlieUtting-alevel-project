### Overview

Project Zomboid is an open world survival game where you have to survive in a zombie apocalypse for as long as they possibly can.  Released on the 8th of October 2013, it is on it can run on Windows, Linux, and OS X.  Its perspective is third person and top down and is similar to a dungeon crawler as it uses field of view dependent on light.

### Player customisation

At the start of the game you can customise the appearance of your character and you also have to pick abilities and disadvantages which have to balance to make the game have more challenge whilst also making it have perks for the player which can be used to negate the difficulty and will make the game different every time you play it and give it multiple play styles for the player to try and master.

### Top down perspective

The top down perspective of the game makes the game easier to see the zombies and can be attacked and it makes it easier to have darkness and field of view like in a dungeon crawler.  It also makes the game have more planes to traverse other than left and right but still have the game with 2D assets like in pok√©mon games.

### Zombies and structure destruction

The game's main challenge is the zombies who can also break through doors or windows when it becomes aware of your presence through making a noise or them seeing you and then will continue to pursue and other zombies are able to go through the same cleared route as the one made by the last.  This makes the difficulty of the game more consistent as you cant just hide in structures to be able to escape the zombies and makes it more imperative that you do not create noise without good reason and checking your surroundings.

### Online

The game has an online mode in which a player can invite their friends to play and survive with them.  The server size is up to 100 people and you can both host and join servers.  It also has multiplayer in split screen.

### Defence Building

The game also has a sandbox survival game which allows the player to build barricades and craft items to survive.  This also includes the construction of buildings as well.

| Entrances Breaking    | I think this is essential to provide the game with some difficulty and will prevent players from just running inside to hide from zombies.                                                                               |

| Top-down perspective  | I think this will give the game more exploitability and challenge as you can explore North, South, East, and West in stead of just left and right and up and down like in 2D games like Terraria.                        |
| Attributes            | I will add attributes as it allows the player to have more than one play through and will add challenge to the game.                                                                                                     |
| Building blockades    | I will include this as it will allow people to fortify structures and temporary structures and therefore be able to collect items in the game as it will be able to create more time as they will have to break through. |

### Overview

Terraria is a 2D survival game with a camera from the side where you can traverse left and right.  The game has a number of bosses and has mining to gain minerals to craft tools and armour and you can collect wood from trees and forage for other things.

### Armour

At the start of the game you can customise the appearance of your character and you also have to pick abilities and disadvantages which have to balance to make the game have more challenge whilst also making it have perks for the player which can be used to negate the difficulty and will make the game different every time you play it and give it multiple play styles for the player to try and master.

### Side View

The perspective is a side scroller which looks at the 2D player from the a set distance and then follows the player like in a platformer game like Mario.

### Bosses

The games main objective is to defeat the bosses including things like the Eye of Cthulhu which is a huge flying eye with teeth and has a 33.33% chance that it will spawn at the start of the night if the certain parameters are met like if the player has over 200HP.  It can also be summoned and if the player does not defeat it by the end of the night it will disappear.  When the eye dies it drops one of two types of resources which can be used to make armour or weapons which is the reason people fight it.
