## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is removing unnecessary details from a problem so that the solutions will be more simple and efficient by only focussing on the essential details to solve the problem.  This will make  the game more enjoyable as you can make core aspects of the game more enjoyable.  My key features will be:

* A map that is laid out to appear like a town with roads, paths/sidewalks, and houses.  This does will not need to be highly populated by objects or items like cars and shrubs and will focus mostly on the street.  The layout also needs to be able to progress the story by making them go to the harder areas of the map for better rewards.
* A playable character which will could have positive and negative affects(like running faster) if the player chooses to have them at the start of the game.  The player will need to be able to attack things and pickup things like weapons.
* The map will need to include places for the player to obtain things like crafting materials which would be in boxes or drawers and some materials and weapons need to be rarer than less valuable items.  These materials can be used to craft things like weapons which will damage the zombies more when fired at them and barriers to protect certain areas of the game.  Lastly, I want to include vehicles that the player will be able to drive that will be available abandoned on the pavement and will have acceleration physics when you drive them.
* The main challenge in my game will be zombies.  They will spawn in all areas of the map and they will be more dense in harder parts of the game around later the bosses of the later part of the story.  When the player collides with a zombie they will loose some health from their health bar and when their health bar reaches 0 they will loose/die in the game.  There will be multiple types of zombies, with some being faster or bigger and there will also be bosses which are zombies that are particularly hard to defeat and will require you to prepare which spawn in a certain zone in the map.
* The game will also include puzzles to access the bosses and the player will interact with things like levers and keys to be able to open doors or avoid zombies to get to the boss fight and then earn valuable materials and progress the story.
