## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is removing unnecessary details from a problem so that the solutions will be more simple and efficient by only focussing on the essential details to solve the problem.  This will make the game more enjoyable as you can make core aspects of the game more fun.  My key features will be:

* A map that is laid out to appear like a town with roads, paths/sidewalks, and houses.  This does will not need to be highly populated by objects or items like cars and shrubs and will focus mostly on the street.  The layout also needs to be able to progress the story by making them go to the harder areas of the map for better rewards.
* A playable character which will could have positive and negative affects(like running faster) if the player chooses to have them at the start of the game.  The player will need to be able to attack things and pickup things like weapons.
* The map will need to include places for the player to obtain things like crafting materials which would be in boxes or drawers and some materials and weapons need to be rarer than less valuable items.  These materials can be used to craft things like weapons which will damage the zombies more when fired at them and barriers to protect certain areas of the game.  Lastly, I want to include vehicles that the player will be able to drive that will be available abandoned on the pavement and will have acceleration physics when you drive them.
* The main challenge in my game will be zombies.  They will spawn in all areas of the map and they will be more dense in harder parts of the game around later the bosses of the later part of the story.  When the player collides with a zombie they will loose some health from their health bar and when their health bar reaches 0 they will loose/die in the game.  There will be multiple types of zombies, with some being faster or bigger and there will also be bosses which are zombies that are particularly hard to defeat and will require you to prepare which spawn in a certain zone in the map.
* The game will also include puzzles to access the bosses and the player will interact with things like levers and keys to be able to open doors or avoid zombies to get to the boss fight and then earn valuable materials and progress the story.

## Thinking Ahead

In terms of computational thinking, thinking ahead is taking in to consideration both preconditions and inputs, then think about the output, and ensuring that the outcome is efficient.  This is so that you think about what the final product of the game will look like and create a logical way to achieve this.



## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of breaking a larger problem in to smaller and more manageable sub-problems which are easier to solve, understand, then programme.  This is especially important when creating a game as the task of creating a game seems unmanageable and you would not know where to start but if you decompose it into a smaller and more manageable problem.  This also makes the it easier to refactor or edit certain parts of the code which is used often to make the game more efficient.

The subtasks that I will be focusing on will be outlined in my [success criteria](1.5-success-criteria.md) and the completion will be documented in my [development cycles](broken-reference).

## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically is choosing where decisions need to be made and what the conditions will do to an outcome, which is necessary in game development as you need to decide where decisions are made in the game and how the state of the game now will affect the final outcome of the decisions.  Some of the main decisions in my game will be:

* When the a key is pressed, the game needs to decide how this will affect the game.  For example, if the player presses W, the game will move the player forward.
* The game needs to decide when a player has entered a vehicle.
* The zombies also need to be able to follow the player if the go too close to them or make a noise.
* When the player respawns after a death the game will need to decide where to respawn the player.

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently is considering what tasks can be done at the same time to make the game run smoothly while multiple processes are running concurrently.
