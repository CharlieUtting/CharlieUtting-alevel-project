## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is removing unnecessary details from a problem so that the solutions will be more simple and efficient by only focussing on the essential details to solve the problem Key features:

* A map that is laid out to appear like a town with roads, paths/sidewalks, and houses.  This does will not need to be highly populated by objects or items like cars and shrubs and will focus mostly on the street.
* The main challenge in my game will be zombies.  They will spawn in all areas of the map and they will be more dense in harder parts of the game around later the bosses of the later part of the story.  When the player collides with a zombie they will loose some health from their health bar and when their health bar reaches 0 they will loose/die in the game.
* The entrance to boss fights will have puzzles which will mean the player is able to access the fight which will have prizes(like hard to get items or powerful weapons) as a reward.
* Items will be generated randomly in certain locations like in boxes when the player opens them.  These items will be essential for the players survival for example food or ammunition.
