## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is removing unnecessary details from a problem so that the solutions will be more simple and efficient by only focussing on the essential details to solve the problem Key features:

* A map that is laid out to appear like a town with roads, paths/sidewalks, and houses.  This does will not need to be highly populated by objects or items like cars and shrubs and will focus mostly on the street.
* The next thing that I will need to create is the playable character which will could have positive and negative affects(like running faster) if the player chooses to have them at the start of the game.  The player will need to be able to attack things and pickup things like weapons.
* The map will need to include places for the player to obtain things like crafting materials which would be in boxes or drawers.  These materials can be used to craft things like weapons and barriers to protect certain areas of the game.  Lastly, I want to include vehicles that the player will be able to drive that will be available abandoned on the pavement
* The main challenge in my game will be zombies.  They will spawn in all areas of the map and they will be more dense in harder parts of the game around later the bosses of the later part of the story.  When the player collides with a zombie they will loose some health from their health bar and when their health bar reaches 0 they will loose/die in the game.  There will be multiple types of zombies, with some being faster or bigger and there will also be bosses which are zombies that are particularly hard to defeat and will require you to prepare which spawn in a certain zone in the map.
* The other thing that I want to include is a top down picture of the map - similar to a view you would get from a map application - in the top left hand corner of the screen which will
