| 1        | The map should consist of a series of roads.  On the side there will be houses with some being enterable.                                                           | This will be where the majority of the exploration in the game happens.                                                                                                       | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) |
| 2        | There will be 10 roads should be laid out to imitate the layout of a town.  Each road will have a different level of difficulty.                                    | This will allow the player to explore the map whilst keeping it small enough to be efficiently loaded.                                                                        | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) |
| 3        | The roads that are further from where the player will spawn will be harder to beat.                                                                                 | This means that the player will get a proficiency for the game in the easier areas and get better weapons and then be able to beat the sections they could not at the start.  |                                                         |
| 4        | The house that the player will spawn in will be their base, which they are able to craft in and defend themselves.                                                  | This will mean that the player will have to retrieve materials that they want to craft with and take them back with out loosing them, which adds challenge.                   |                                                         |
| 5        | There will be two bosses and both will have to have a puzzle completed for the player to be able to get to them.                                                    | This will add a sense of purpose to the game and progress the story.                                                                                                          |                                                         |
| 6        | There will be a story with the objective being finding out how the zombie apocalypse started by reading notes about it left after the two bosses and other enemies. | This will, again, give the player more of a reason to complete the game as they will have to progress to find out more about the story.                                       |                                                         |
| 7        |                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                         |
