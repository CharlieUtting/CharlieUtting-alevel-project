|     1    | The map should have a bottom layer which has the road layout and other things that the player can walk over.                                                          | This will be where the player is able to walk through to navigate the game.                                                                                                   | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|     2    | The second layer of the game will have things that are built on top of the floor and will mostly be made up of things that the player cannot pass through like walls. | This will make it so the player cannot go through things that are supposed to be solid.                                                                                       | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|     3    | The final layers will be object layers that will consist of certain types of objects with different properties like bushes.                                           | This could make the game have some interactivity and will again make the game look more realistic.                                                                            | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|     4    | There will be 5 roads should be laid out to imitate the layout of a town.  Each road will have a different level of difficulty.                                       | This will allow the player to explore the map whilst keeping it small enough to be efficiently loaded.                                                                        | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |
|     5    | The roads that are further from where the player will spawn will be harder to beat as there will be more zombies.                                                     | This means that the player will get a proficiency for the game in the easier areas and get better weapons and then be able to beat the sections they could not at the start.  | <p><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">Map Design</a>, <br><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md">Project<br>Zomboid</a></p> |

|     7    | There will be two bosses and both will have to have a puzzle completed for the player to be able to get to them.                                                      | This will add a sense of purpose to the game and progress the story.                                                                                                          | <p><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">Map Design</a>, <br><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md">Terraria</a></p>           |
|     8    | There will be a story with the objective being finding out how the zombie apocalypse started by reading notes about it left after the two bosses and other enemies.   | This will, again, give the player more of a reason to complete the game as they will have to progress to find out more about the story.                                       | <p><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">Map Design</a>, <br><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md">Deadlight</a></p>          |

|    10    | The player's will need to move so when you use the W, A, S, and D keys or the arrow keys the player will move relative to where the mouse is(W moves the player toward the mouse). | This will allow the player to interact with the game.                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                           |

### Non-Functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| 18       | The game will have no sexual references and minimal depictions of graphic violence. | This will keep the game suitable for the greatest age range.                                                                                    | [Stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md)                            |
| 19       | The game should be somewhat difficult                                               | This is so that it is enjoyable for the target audience.                                                                                        | [Stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md)                            |
| 20       | The game should be able to run smoothly without crashing.                           | This will keep the attention on the game and will mean that the game will not loose save data.                                                  | [Saving Progress](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)   |
| 21       | The game should have good performance.                                              | This will increase the playability of the game as it is more fun if the game is more responsive and loads faster.                               | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md)         |

| 23       | The map should be set in an a town.                                                 | This will mean that the game makes sense to why there are so many zombies there and it  will make it more like the typical zombie movie.        | [Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)            |
