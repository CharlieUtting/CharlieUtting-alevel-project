Each road will have a different level of difficulty.                                    | This will allow the player to explore the map whilst keeping it small enough to be efficiently loaded.                                                                        | [Map Design](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                                                                     |

|     8    | There will be two bosses and both will have to have a puzzle completed for the player to be able to get to them.                                                    | This will add a sense of purpose to the game and progress the story.                                                                                                          | <p><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">Map Design</a>, <br><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md">Terraria</a></p>           |
|     9    | There will be a story with the objective being finding out how the zombie apocalypse started by reading notes about it left after the two bosses and other enemies. | This will, again, give the player more of a reason to complete the game as they will have to progress to find out more about the story.                                       | <p><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">Map Design</a>, <br><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md">Deadlight</a></p>          |

### Non-Functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
