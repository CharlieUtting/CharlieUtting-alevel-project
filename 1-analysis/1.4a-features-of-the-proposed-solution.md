# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Design and Graphics

### Map

The map needs to be so that the player has space to explore.  I can use a map editor to design a map which will have preloaded building, with some level of destruction of things like windows and doors, and to create places for bosses/harder enemies to be for the player to have to confront for the story to continue and get better items.

## Mechanics

### Controls

Because the game will be a web game, it will only be available on a computer with internet access.  Due to this, the game's controls will use the keyboard.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
