# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the objective of the game clear? Do you know where to go to progress the game?                    |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls easy to use? Does the player move too fast? What controls would you change, if any? |
| 3 - Engaging       | Does the game make you want to continue playing or become better? Is the game difficult?             |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | <p>Where there any bugs?</p><p>If there were any bugs, what were they?</p>                           |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is it clear when you have failed the game? Are the controls easy to pick-up.                         |

Below are the results to the question. I will evaluate the results in depth in my evaluation section.

### Effective

#### Question 1

This is a very important question to ask as it is essential that the player is able to work out what they are working towards in order to properly play the game which is the main purpose of the game. Because they know how what it is, the text usability requirement was a success and so is the objectives usability feature.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was necessary to show if the player could identify where they needed to go to collect more iron and this was designed to lead them through the level. Seeing as they also knew where to go to progress the game, the iron usability requirement was also a success.

### Efficient

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was asked as it is important that the controls in the game are usable because if the controls are unusable then the game will be a worse experience. This was a positive response meaning that the game is functional and the control usability feature is at least a partial success as it means that the game is playable.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is another important question as it identifies if the controls usability feature could have been improved and therefore improve the experience of the game. A few people suggested improvements for the controls. Most of the answers were with the controls using the arrow keys instead of the WASD keys which was my original plan. They also say that the cursor could have directed the player but I still think that this means that the controls usability feature was a success as most of the problems were small.

#### Question 3

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question is also to do with the controls as it is to determine if the controls are too sensitive which affects if the player can play the game with out being hindered by the player movement. The responses to this question show that it was not a problem and therefor the controls usability feature is overall a success.

### Engaging

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question is important as it was one of my success criteria that the game was difficult because the element of challenge will mean that the game is more engaging. I do not want the answers to be too weighted to one extreme as this will mean that the game is too difficult to complete and people will become disinterested and give up but I want it to be more agreeing with the game being difficult. Because the answers agree with what I said above and the majority of the answers are neutral or agreeing I think that the challenge usability feature was a success.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is related to the last question as if the game is somewhat difficult then that game will make you want to improve and therefore get continue playing so this question is important to see if the game is engaging. The answers again show that the challenge usability feature was a success.

### Error Tolerant

#### Question 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game should not have many bugs in it. People experienced a few which will need to be fixed.

#### Question 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question is an extension of the last. Most of the bugs involved phasers collision handling including being pushed through a hedge the health taking a while to decrease and the bullets not disappearing or randomly disappearing. These bugs will need to be fixed before any more development can continue.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 19        | The game will have no sexual references and minimal depictions of graphic violence.                     |
| 20        | The game should be somewhat difficult                                                                   |
| 21        | The game should be able to run smoothly without crashing.                                               |
| 22        | The game should perform well(the game should have a high frame rate and should have low loading times). |

| 25        | The game should outline its objectives.                                                                 |
