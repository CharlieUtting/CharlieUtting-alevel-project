# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the objective of the game clear? Do you know where to go to progress the game?                                        |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls easy to use? Does the player move too fast? What controls would you change, if any?                     |
| 3 - Engaging       | Does the game make you want to continue playing or become better? Does the game look like a town? Is the game difficult? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | <p>Where there any bugs?</p><p>If there were any bugs, what were they?</p>                                               |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is it clear when you have failed the game? Are the controls easy to pick-up.                                             |

Below are the results to the question. I will evaluate the results in depth in my evaluation section.

### Effective

#### Question 1

This is a very important question to ask as it is essential that the player is able to work out what they are working towards in order to properly play the game which is the main purpose of the game. Because they know how what it is, the text usability requirement was a success and so is the objectives usability feature.

#### Question 2



This question was necessary to show if the player could identify where they needed to go to collect more iron and this was designed to lead them through the level. Seeing as they also knew where to go to progress the game, the iron usability requirement was also a success.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                             |
