# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the objective of the game clear? Do you know where to go to progress the game?                                        |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls easy to use? Does the player move too fast? What controls would you change, if any?                     |
| 3 - Engaging       | Does the game make you want to continue playing or become better? Does the game look like a town? Is the game difficult? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | <p>Where there any bugs?</p><p>If there were any bugs, what were they?</p>                                               |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Is it clear when you have failed the game? Are the controls easy to pick-up.                                             |

Below are the results to the question. I will evaluate the results in depth in my evaluation section.

### User Feedback
