# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

My success criteria contained 2 requirements in relation to the function and robustness of the game. Seeing as the development of the game is now halted due to the time constraints of the project, it is now an appropriate time to run these tests.

| Criterion | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 21        | It should be able to run smoothly without crashing. |
| 22        | It should perform well (have a high frame rates)    |

### Criterion 21
