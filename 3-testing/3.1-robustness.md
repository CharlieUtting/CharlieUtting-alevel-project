# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

My success criteria contained 2 requirements in relation to the function and robustness of the game. Seeing as the development of the game is now halted due to the time constraints of the project, it is now an appropriate time to run these tests.

| Criterion | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 21        | It should be able to run smoothly without crashing. |
| 22        | It should perform well (have a high frame rates)    |

### Criterion 21

For this part of the testing I had to push the game to its limits to stress test it. I did this by entering unusual inputs that I had not planned for. There were no bugs in this part of the testing and my code did what I expected. There were some bugs that could be used to exploit the game:

* The player could be pushed through the walls and bushes by the zombies and then could walk out the other side of the wall while the zombies were still stuck on the other side.
* When the player got the later gun upgrades the bullets would not disappear when they shot at a wall that was far away and the bullets would loose all of their speed.
