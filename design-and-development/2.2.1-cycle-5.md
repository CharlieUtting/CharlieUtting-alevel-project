# 2.2.1 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope that I can make the map to have an actual structure and make the player collide and interact with it.

* [x] Have the player collide with the edge of the map.
* [x] Complete the map so that with all of the streets.
* [x] Add bushes to stop the player from being able to access all of the map.
* [x] Make player face mouse pointer.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| target        | This is the variable that holds where the player is aiming to face. |

### Pseudocode

```
create(){
...
    define belowLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
    define worldLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)

    
    set collisions by property worldLayer({collides: true})
    
    physics add collider between(worldLayer, player)
    
    player body collides with world bounds = true
    
    input on('pointermove', function (pointer){
        target = (Phaser angle between(player, mousepointer)
    })
    update(){
    player rotation = target
    ...
    } 
}
```

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                  | What I expect                                               | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                      | The map to load with the parts that I added.                | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Move mouse                    | The player turns in the direction that I turned the mouse.  | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run in to the edge of the map | The player to not be able to leave the map that I have made | As expected.          | Pass      |
