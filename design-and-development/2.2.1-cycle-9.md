# 2.2.1 Cycle 9

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to make the iron intractable and to be able to finish the feature.

* [x] Make a fix so that the player faces in the direction of the mouse in what ever position they are in the map as if you move it is looking at the coordinate of the mouse on the screen not on the map.
* [x] Spawn in bullets when the player presses the mouse
* [x] Make the bullets move towards the mouse position.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ironGoal      | This is the variable that will store the amount of iron the player needs to upgrade their weapon. |
| ironGoals     | An array for all of the goals for the levels.                                                     |
| i             | Where the player is in the array.                                                                 |
| damage        | To store how much damage the player will do.                                                      |

### Pseudocode

```
define ironGoal = 6;
define ironGoals = [6,12,15,16,25]//amount of iron on each level
define i=0;

create(){
...
    
    text = addText(570, 70, "Iron:" ironCount "/"ironGoal ,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    text setScrollFactor(0)

```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import ironImg from './assets/iron.png'

let ironGoal = 6;
const ironGoals = [6,12,15,16,25];
let i = 0;
let damage = 5;//starting damage.

function create(){
    //...
    this.physics.add.collider(player, iron, collectIron, null, this)

    text = this.add.text(570, 70, `Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`, {
        fontSize: '20px',
        fill: '#ffffff'
    });
    text.setScrollFactor(0);
    //...
}
function collectIron(player, iron){
    iron.destroy(iron.x, iron.y);
    ironCount++
    if(ironCount == ironGoal){
        i++
        ironCount = 0;
        ironGoal = ironGoals[i];
        damage= damage*2;
    }
    text.setText(`Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`);

    return false;
}
//...
```

### Challenges

This task was quite straight forward so the main challenge learning how to make the individual pieces of iron disappear and putting the function in the right order so that the text is updated correctly.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                | What I expect                                                                                  | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                                    | The amount of iron and the ironGoal should be displayed in the top right corner of the screen. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Run into the iron.                          | The iron should disappear and iron should be added to the ironCount.                           | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run into the amount of iron in the ironGoal | ironCount resets and the ironGoal changes next ironGoal.                                       | As expected.          | Pass      |
