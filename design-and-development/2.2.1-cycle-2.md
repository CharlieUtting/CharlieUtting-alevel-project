# 2.2.1 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

Make Phaser work and display something.

* [x] Make Phaser run.
* [x] Create and export a tile map with Tiled.
* [x] Preload the tile set and the tile map.
* [x] Load in the map.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| config        | This object allows you to configure the game including the game window                                       |
| game          | Local variable which Phaser.Game is assigned to.                                                             |
| map           | This will be the variable will be used to load the appearance of the map that the player will be playing in. |
| tileset       | Variable that will load all of the textures that will be needed to load the map.                             |
| Layer         | The base layer for my map. I will create more when I have added more things like buildings and objects/      |

### Pseudocode

File for configuring phaser:

```
import Phaser

//Importing main code file.
import MainCode

define config
    width: 640,
    height: 480,
    scene: MainCode
```

Main game code(MainCode):

```
define class MainCode
    //defining the variable and its type after
    map: any
    tileset: any
    layer: any
    
    constructor()
        super(key:MainCode)
    
    preload
        //preload tileset
        load image(tiles, adress of image in assets folder)
        load tilemap(map, address of map in assets folder)
    
    create
        map = make tilemap(map)//uses the map from the preload
        //uses the name of the tileset file name and what you named it in the preload
        tileset = add tileset(tileset name, tiles)
        
        layer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
```

## Development

### Outcome

In main.ts I created the window with size and set the background colour of the window and other variables.  In PlayScene.ts I defined the variables needed to load the tile map like the map variable. In the preload function I loaded the image for the tile set and the tile map in json.

{% tab title="main.ts" %}

### Tests

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                                                              | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run Server           | When I go to the local host it displays my web-page.                       | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Display a background | When the code is run It displays a sky background.                         | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Make Platforms       | Have platforms that use the ground png.                                    | As expected           | Pass      |
| 4    | Make Physics         | Have arcade physics for the platformer.                                    | As expected           | Pass      |
| 5    | Add player           | Make a sprite using the guy sprite sheet that will eventually be playable. | As expected           | Pass      |
