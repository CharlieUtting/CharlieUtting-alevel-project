# 2.2.1 Cycle 11

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I want to make the zombies interact with the player.

* [x] Change the font and change all of the text to bitmap text.
* [x] Add in a game over screen when the player dies.
* [x] Make the player invisible when the game ends.
* [x] Stop the physics when you loose the game.
* [x] Don't allow the player to be able to have their health go below 0.
* [x] Spawn in a boss when the player gets the max amount of iron.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| arcade        | This is the variable that holds the font that I am going to use for the game.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| zombie        | The variable that will store the individual zombies when they are created.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| zombies       | Group of sprites with physics for the zombies to be a part of. This will mean that I can make colliders for a whole group of sprites like in the iron cycle.                                                                                             |
| health        | The variable that will reduce when the player is in contact with the zombies.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| i             | This is the variable that will be used in the for loop to compare the amount of zombies(i) to the amount that is wanted.                                                                                                                                 |
| cooldown      | A boolean which is similar to the delay variable which stops the player from taking too much damage all at once. Their will be a variable for each zombie so that if you are in contact with more than one they will take your health at a greater rate. |
| h             | health variables for the individual zombies.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| damage        | The amount of health that will be removed from the zombies when they are hit by a bullet. This will be doubled when the ironGoal variable is met and was first initialised earlier.                                                                      |

    constructor (scene, x, y, texture)
    {
        super(scene, x, y, texture)
    }
    preUpdate (time, delta)
    {
        super.preUpdate(time, delta);
    }
}
```

```
create{
    //...
    text2 = addText(570, 70, "Health:" health,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    coords = addText(570, 70, `X: ${player.x} Y: ${player.y}`,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    zombies = physics.group
    for (define i = 0; i < 50; i++){
        zombie = new Zombie(numberBetween(0,1784), numberBetween(0,1784), zombieImg)
        add zombies(zombie)
    }
    
    zombies.child{
        child.CollideWorldBounds=true
    }
    collider(zombies,zombies)
    collider(zombies,worldLayer)
    collider(zombies, player, takeDamage())
}

update{
    //...
    
    zombies.child{
        child.moveTo(player, speed:120)
        child.rotation=angle.betweenPoints(child, player)
    }
    
    set coords(`X: ${player.x} Y: ${player.y}`)
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
        //...
        collider(zombie, bullet, zomDie())
}

function zomDie(bullet,zombie){
    zombie.h = zombie.h - damage;
    
    destroy bullet
    if zombie.h <= 0 {
        destroy zombie
    }
}

takeDamage(){
    if zombie.cooldown == false{
        health = health - 3
        zombie.cooldown = true
        delayedCall(200, function cd(){zombie.cooldown = false})
        set text2(`Health: ${health}`)
    }

### Challenges



## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                                                                                                                                                                                              | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code             | There should be multiple zombies around the map. The player's health and coordinates should be displayed at the top right of the screen. The zombies should also look at the player and follow the player. | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 2    | Move the player      | The zombies should continue to look at the player and should move towards the new location of the player.                                                                                                  | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run into the zombie. | You should collide with the zombie. The player's health in the top right should go down.                                                                                                                   | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 4    | Shoot the zombie.    | The zombie should disappear after 5 shots as the health is 100 and you inflict 20 damage(until the amount of damage is upgraded when you hit the ironGoal).                                                | As expected.          | Pass      |
