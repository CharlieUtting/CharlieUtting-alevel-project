# 2.2.1 Cycle 11

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I want to make the zombies interact with the player.

* [x] Change the font and change all of the text to bitmap text.
* [x] Add in a game over screen when the player dies.
* [x] Make the player invisible when the game ends.
* [x] Stop the physics when you loose the game.
* [x] Don't allow the player to be able to have their health go below 0.
* [x] Spawn in a boss when the player gets the max amount of iron. The boss will be part of the Zombie class and part of the zombies physics group.&#x20;
* [x] Make a variable for the zombie damage that goes up when the player reaches the boss so that&#x20;

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| arcade        | This is the variable that holds the font that I am going to use for the game.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| gameOver      | The variable for the gameOver text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| boss          | This is the variable for the boss sprite that will spawn at the end of the game. This will be part of the Zombie class and will be in the zombies physics group.                                                                                         |
| health        | The variable that will reduce when the player is in contact with the zombies and the boss.                                                                                                                                                               |
| i             | This is the variable that was used to mark the place in the array ironGoals.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| cooldown      | A boolean which is similar to the delay variable which stops the player from taking too much damage all at once. There will be a variable for each zombie so that if you are in contact with more than one they will take your health at a greater rate. |
| h             | health variables for the individual zombies and the boss.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| zomDam        | The variable that will store the amount of damage that the members of the zombies physic group will do.                                                                                                                                                  |
| speed         | The variable for the speed of the zombie so that that the boss can be slower so that the player is able to defeat it more easily.                                                                                                                        |

### Pseudocode

<pre><code><strong>define zomDam = 3
</strong>define boss

preload{
    ...
    load bitmapFont(arcade, address of font image in assets folder, adress of the font xml file in the assets folder)
}</code></pre>

```
create{
    ...
    text = addbitmapText(x:390, y:20, font: arcade, `Iron: ${ironCount} out of ${ironGoal}`, size: 15)

    text2 = addbitmapText(x:20, y:20, font: arcade, `Health:$ {health}`, size: 15)
    
    coords = addbitmapText(x:20, y:40, font: arcade, `X: ${player.x} Y: ${player.y}`, size: 15)

    gameOver = addbitmapText(x:320, y:240, font: arcade, `Game Over`, size: 50)

    gameOver visible = false
    ...
}
...
function collectIron(){
    destroy iron
    ironCount++
    if ironCount == ironGoal{
        i++
        ironGoal = ironGoals[i]
        damage = damage * 2
    }
    set text(`Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`)
    if i == 5{
        boss = new Zombie(32, 1722, zombieImg)
        bossScale(x: 4, y: 4)
        add zombies(boss)
        zomDam = 20
        health = 120

### Challenges



## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                                                                                                                                                                                              | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code             | There should be multiple zombies around the map. The player's health and coordinates should be displayed at the top right of the screen. The zombies should also look at the player and follow the player. | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 2    | Move the player      | The zombies should continue to look at the player and should move towards the new location of the player.                                                                                                  | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run into the zombie. | You should collide with the zombie. The player's health in the top right should go down.                                                                                                                   | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 4    | Shoot the zombie.    | The zombie should disappear after 5 shots as the health is 100 and you inflict 20 damage(until the amount of damage is upgraded when you hit the ironGoal).                                                | As expected.          | Pass      |
