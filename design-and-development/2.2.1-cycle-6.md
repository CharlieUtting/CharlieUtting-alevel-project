# 2.2.1 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope that I can make the map to have an actual structure and make the player collide and interact with it.

* [ ] Install and import MRPAS (Mingo's Restrictive Precise Angle Shadowcasting)
* [x] Make it so that there is no shadow cast by the lower level of the map.
* [x] Add a field of view.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |

### Pseudocode

```
create(){
...
    define belowLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
    define worldLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
    define objectLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)

    
    set collisions by property worldLayer({collides: true})
    set collisions by property objectLayer({collides: true})
    
    physics add collider between(worldLayer, player)
    physics add collider between(objectLayer, player)
    
    player body collides with world bounds = true
...
}
```

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code     |               | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    |              |               | As expected.          | Pass      |
