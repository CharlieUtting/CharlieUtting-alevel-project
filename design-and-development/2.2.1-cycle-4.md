# 2.2.1 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope that I can make the map to have an actual structure and make the player collide and interact with it.

* [x] Make buildings on the map.
* [x] Add collide property to buildings and objects.
* [x] Make the player collide with things that have the collide property.
