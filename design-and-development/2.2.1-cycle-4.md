# 2.2.1 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope that I can make the map to have an actual structure and make the player collide and interact with it.

* [x] Make buildings on the map.
* [x] Add collide property to buildings and objects.
* [x] Make the player collide with things that have the collide property.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| worldLayer    | This is the layer that holds the buildings and other things that are placed on top of the ground/lower layer of the map.       |
| collides      | This is a boolean which you define when you make the map and then you use it to define what will be colliding with the player. |

### Pseudocode

```
create(){
...
    define belowLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
    define worldLayer = create static layer(name of layer in Tiled, tileset, X: 0, Y:0)
    
    set collisions by property worldLayer({collides: true})
    
    physics add collider between(worldLayer, player)
...
}
```

### Tests

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect     | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code      | Thing happens     | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Press buttons | Something happens | As expected           | Pass      |
