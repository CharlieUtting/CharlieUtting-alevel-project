# 2.2.1 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I want to make the zombies interact with the player.

* [x] Display the players coordinates on the map so that I can change where things spawn.
* [x] Make the zombie face the player.
* [x] Make the zombie move toward the player.
* [x] Make the zombies take the player's health.
* [x] Add a cooldown that means the player's health cannot be reduced all at once when the zombie stays in contact with the player.
* [x] Spawn in an amount of zombies randomly on the map.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| zombies       | Group of sprites with physics for the zombies to be apart of. This will mean that I can make colliders for a whole group of sprites like in the iron cycle. |
| health        | The variable that will reduce when the player is in contact with the zombies.                                                                               |
| i             | This is the variable that will be used in the for loop to compare the amount of zombies(i) to the amount that is wanted.                                    |
| cooldown      | A boolean which is similar to the delay variable which stops the player from taking too much damage all at once.                                            |

### Pseudocode

```
class Zombie extends sprite{
    define health;
    constructor (scene, x, y, texture)
    {
        super(scene, x, y, texture)
    }
    preUpdate (time, delta)
    {
        super.preUpdate(time, delta);
    }
}
```

```
create{
    //...
    for(define i = 0; i < 50; i++){
        
    }
}

update{
    //...
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
        //...
        collider(zombie, bullet, zomDie())
}

zomDie{
    destroy zombie
    destroy bullet
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import zomImg from './assets/zombie.png'
//...
let zombie
//...
class Zombie extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite {

    constructor (scene, x, y, texture)
    {
        super(scene, x, y, texture);
        this.scene.add.existing(this);

    }



    preUpdate (time, delta)
    {
        super.preUpdate(time, delta);

    }
}
//...

function create{
    zombie = new Zombie(this, 100, 100, 'zombieImg')

}
//...

function zomDie(zombie,bullet){
    zombie.destroy(zombie.x, zombie.y)
    bullet.destroy(bullet.x, bullet.y)
}

function update (){
    //...
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
            //...
            this.physics.add.collider(bullet, zombies, zomDie)
        }
    }
//...
```

### Challenges

This cycle wasn't very difficult as it was mainly just implementing things that I had already done into the code again but for the zombies this time. For example the delay for the health had already been done before.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                        | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code             | The zombie should have been created. | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 2    | Run into the zombie. | You should collide with the zombie.  | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Shoot the zombie.    | The zombie should disappear.         | As expected.          | Pass      |
