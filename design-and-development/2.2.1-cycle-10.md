# 2.2.1 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I want to make the zombies interact with the player.

* [x] Display the players coordinates on the map so that I can change where things spawn.
* [x] Make the zombie face the player.
* [x] Make the zombie move toward the player.
* [x] Make the zombies take the player's health.
* [x] Add a cooldown that means the player's health cannot be reduced all at once when the zombie stays in contact with the player. Make the cooldown variable part of the class so each zombie has one.
* [x] Spawn in an amount of zombies randomly on the map.
* [x] Add health for the zombies.
* [x] Have zombies die after their health reaches 0.
* [x] Display the players health on the screen.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| coords        | The variable for the text that will display the coordinates of the player.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| zombie        | The variable that will store the individual zombies when they are created.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| zombies       | Group of sprites with physics for the zombies to be a part of. This will mean that I can make colliders for a whole group of sprites like in the iron cycle.                                                                                             |
| health        | The variable that will reduce when the player is in contact with the zombies.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| i             | This is the variable that will be used in the for loop to compare the amount of zombies(i) to the amount that is wanted.                                                                                                                                 |
| cooldown      | A boolean which is similar to the delay variable which stops the player from taking too much damage all at once. Their will be a variable for each zombie so that if you are in contact with more than one they will take your health at a greater rate. |
| h             | health variables for the individual zombies.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Pseudocode

```
define damage = 20
define coords
define text2
define zombie
define zombies
define health = 100

class Zombie extends sprite{
    define cooldown = false
    define h = 100
    constructor (scene, x, y, texture)
    {
        super(scene, x, y, texture)
    }
    preUpdate (time, delta)
    {
        super.preUpdate(time, delta);
    }
}
```

```
create{
    //...
    text2 = addText(570, 70, "Health:" health,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    coords = addText(570, 70, player.x & player.y,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    zombies = physics.group
    for (define i = 0; i < 50; i++){
        zombie = new Zombie(numberBetween(0,1784), numberBetween(0,1784), zombieImg)
        add zombies(zombie)
    }
    collider(zombies,zombies)
    collider(zombies,worldLayer)
    collider(zombies, player, takeDamage())
}

update{
    //...
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
        //...
        collider(zombie, bullet, zomDie())
}

function zomDie(bullet,zombie){
    zombie.h = zombie.h - damage;
    
    destroy bullet
    if zombie.h <= 0 {
        destroy zombie
    }
}

takeDamage(){
    if zombie.cooldown == false{
        health = health - 3
        zombie.cooldown = true
        delayedCall(200, function cd(){zombie.cooldown = false})
        set text2(`Health: ${health}`)
    }
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import zomImg from './assets/zombie.png'
//...
let zombie
//...
class Zombie extends Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite {

    constructor (scene, x, y, texture)
    {
        super(scene, x, y, texture);
        this.scene.add.existing(this);

    }



    preUpdate (time, delta)
    {
        super.preUpdate(time, delta);

    }
}
//...

function create{
    zombie = new Zombie(this, 100, 100, 'zombieImg')

}
//...

function zomDie(zombie,bullet){
    zombie.destroy(zombie.x, zombie.y)
    bullet.destroy(bullet.x, bullet.y)
}

function update (){
    //...
    if (this.input.mousePointer.isDown && control == false) {
            //...
            this.physics.add.collider(bullet, zombies, zomDie)
        }
    }
//...
```

### Challenges

This cycle wasn't very difficult as it was mainly just implementing things that I had already done into the code again but for the zombies this time. For example the delay for the health had already been done before.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions         | What I expect                        | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code             | The zombie should have been created. | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 2    | Run into the zombie. | You should collide with the zombie.  | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Shoot the zombie.    | The zombie should disappear.         | As expected.          | Pass      |
