# 2.2.1 Cycle 7



## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I hope to make the iron intractable and to be able to finish the feature.

* [x] Make the iron disappear when the player collides with it.
* [x] Add to the ironCount variable when the player collides with the iron.
* [x] Update the text so that the players iron is displayed after the get it.
* [x] Add in a goal for the iron to hit and make the goal increase when it is met.
* [x] Add a damage variable for weapons later that will increase every time they get a new upgrade.

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ironGoal      | This is the variable that will store the amount of iron the player needs to upgrade their weapon. |
| ironGoals     | An array for all of the goals for the levels.                                                     |
| i             | Where the player is in the array.                                                                 |
| damage        | To store how much damage the player will do.                                                      |

### Pseudocode

```
define ironGoal = 6;
define ironGoals = [6,12,15,16,25]//amount of iron on each level
define i=0;

create(){
...
    
    text = addText(570, 70, "Iron:" ironCount "/"ironGoal ,{
        fontSize = 20px
        fill: #ffffff
    })
    text setScrollFactor(0)

```

## Development

### Outcome

```javascript
import ironImg from './assets/iron.png'

let ironGoal = 6;
const ironGoals = [6,12,15,16,25];
let i = 0;
let damage = 5;//starting damage.

function create(){
    //...
    this.physics.add.collider(player, iron, collectIron, null, this)

    text = this.add.text(570, 70, `Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`, {
        fontSize: '20px',
        fill: '#ffffff'
    });
    text.setScrollFactor(0);
    //...
}
function collectIron(player, iron){
    iron.destroy(iron.x, iron.y);
    ironCount++
    if(ironCount == ironGoal){
        i++
        ironCount = 0;
        ironGoal = ironGoals[i];
        damage= damage*2;
    }
    text.setText(`Iron: ${ironCount}/ ${ironGoal}`);

    return false;
}
//...
```

### Challenges

This task was quite straight forward so the main challenge learning how to make the individual pieces of iron disappear and putting the function in the right order so that the text is updated correctly.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                | What I expect                                                                                  | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                                    | The amount of iron and the ironGoal should be displayed in the top right corner of the screen. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Run into the iron.                          | The iron should disappear and iron should be added to the ironCount.                           | As expected.          | Pass      |
| 3    | Run into the amount of iron in the ironGoal | ironCount resets and the ironGoal changes next ironGoal.                                       | As expected.          | Pass      |
